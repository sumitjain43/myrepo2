#Title of Project : Hill and Valley Prediction using Logistic Regression method

#Objective : To develop an Machine Learning Model to predict Hill and Valley using Logistic Regression method that can accurately classify
geographical locations as either hills or valleys based on a set of input features. The model will be trained on a labeled dataset of geographical 
features and their corresponding classifications, and then evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure its performance. The ultimate goal of 
this project is to provide a useful tool for identifying hills and valleys in various geographic locations, which can have important applications
in fields such as geology, agriculture, and urban planning.


# Import Library :
#import library pandas
import pandas as pd


#Import Data :
#dataset
hill = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/raw/main/Hill%20Valley%20Dataset.csv')
hill.head()
hill.info()


#Describe Data :
hill.describe()
hill.columns
print(hill.columns.tolist())
hill.shape


#Get Unique Values(class) in Y Variable
hill['Class'].value_counts()
hill.groupby('Class').mean()

#Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X)
y = hill['Class']
y.shape
y
X = hill.drop('Class', axis=1)
X.shape
X

#Data Visualization :

#Get Plot of First Two Rows

# import library
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(X.iloc[0,:])
plt.title('Valley');
plt.plot(X.iloc[1,:])
plt.title('Hill');

#Data Preprocessing :

#Get X Variables Standardized
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
ss = StandardScaler()
X = ss.fit_transform(X)
X
X.shape

#Train Test Split :
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size=0.3, stratify=y, random_state=2529)
X_train.shape, X_test.shape, y_train.shape, y_test.shape

#Modeling :
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train,y_train)

#Get Model Prediction :
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred.shape
y_pred

#Probability of each Predicted Class :
model.predict_proba(X_test)

#Model Evaluation :
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
print(confusion_matrix(y_test,y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test,y_pred))
#Future Predictions :

# lets select a random sample from existing dataset as new value
#Steps to follow
# 1)Extract random row using sample function
# 2)Separate X and y
# 3)Standerdize X
# 2)Predict
X_new = hill.sample(1)

X_new = X_new.drop('Class', axis=1)

X_new = ss.fit_transform(X_new)
y_pred_new = model.predict(X_new)

# Explanation :This project is based on the Dasa science using Python Programming language.The main purpose of creating this project is to develop 
a predictive model using logistic regression that can accurately classify geographical locations as either hills or valleys based on a set of input features.
The model will be trained on a labeled dataset of geographical features and their corresponding classifications, and then evaluated on a separate test 
dataset to measure its performance. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a useful tool for identifying hills and valleys in various geographic
locations, which can have important applications in fields such as geology, agriculture, and urban planning.
